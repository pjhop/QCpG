Description: This package aims to bring several sample/probeQC metrics for Illumina methylation beadchips (450k/EPIC) together (MethylAid, minfi, wateRmelon, omicsPrint), and includes new QC metrics and recommendations based on our experience with
  ~10,000 EPIC/450k samples within Project MinE (https://www.projectmine.com/).
