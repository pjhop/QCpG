	abstract = {Summary: OmicsPrint is a versatile method for the detection of data linkage errors in multiple omics studies encompassing genetic, transcriptome and/or methylome data. OmicsPrint evaluates data linkage within and between omics data types using genotype calls from SNP arrays, DNA- or RNA-sequencing data and includes an algorithm to infer genotypes from Illumina DNA methylation array data. The method uses classiﬁcation to verify assumed relationships and detect any data linkage errors, e.g. arising from sample mix-ups and mislabeling. Graphical and text output is provided to inspect and resolve putative data linkage errors. If sufﬁcient genotype calls are available, ﬁrst degree family relations also are revealed which can be used to check parent–offspring relations or zygosity in twin studies.},

	abstract = {Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are designed to characterise populationlevel epigenetic diﬀerences across the genome and link them to disease. Most commonly, they assess DNA-methylation status at cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, using platforms such as the Illumina 450k array that proﬁle a subset of CpGs genome wide. An important challenge in the context of EWAS is determining a significance threshold for declaring a CpG site as diﬀerentially methylated, taking multiple testing into account. We used a permutation method to estimate a signiﬁcance threshold speciﬁcally for the 450k array and a simulation extrapolation approach to estimate a genome-wide threshold. These methods were applied to ﬁve diﬀerent EWAS datasets derived from a variety of populations and tissue types. We obtained an estimate of ������ = 2.4 × 10−7 for the 450k array, and a genome-wide estimate of ������ = 3.6 × 10−8. We further demonstrate the importance of these results by showing that previously recommended sample sizes for EWAS should be adjusted upwards, requiring samples between ∼10\% and ∼20\% larger in order to maintain type-1 errors at the desired level.},

Furthermore, epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) provides a systematic approach to identify epigenetic variants underlying common diseases/phenotypes. However, there is no comprehensive database to archive the results of EWASs. To ﬁll this gap, we developed the EWASdb, which is a part of ’The EWAS Project’, to store the epigenetic association results of DNA methylation from EWASs. In its current version (v 1.0, up to July 2018), the EWASdb has curated 1319 EWASs associated with 302 diseases/phenotypes. There are three types of EWAS results curated in this database: (i) EWAS for single marker; (ii) EWAS for KEGG pathway and (iii) EWAS for GO (Gene Ontology) category. As the ﬁrst comprehensive EWAS database, EWASdb has been searched or downloaded by researchers from 43 countries to date. We believe that EWASdb will become a valuable resource and signiﬁcantly contribute to the epigenetic research of diseases/phenotypes and have potential clinical applications.

We learned a controlled vocabulary of sample labels by applying regular expressions to metadata and used existing models to predict various sample properties including epigenetic age. We found approximately two-thirds of samples were from blood, one-quarter were from brain and one-third were from cancer patients. About 19\% of samples failed at least one of Illumina’s 17 prescribed quality assessments; signal distributions across samples suggest modifying manufacturer-recommended thresholds for failure would make these assessments more informative. We further analyzed DNAm variances in seven tissues (adipose, nasal, blood, brain, buccal, sperm and liver) and characterized speciﬁc probes distinguishing them. Finally, we compiled DNAm array data and metadata, including our learned and predicted sample labels, into database ﬁles accessible via the recountmethylation R/Bioconductor companion package.

            Monozygotic (MZ) twins and higher-order multiples arise when a zygote splits during pre-implantation stages of development. The mechanisms underpinning this event have remained a mystery. Because MZ twinning rarely runs in families, the leading hypothesis is that it occurs at random. Here, we show that MZ twinning is strongly associated with a stable DNA methylation signature in adult somatic tissues. This signature spans regions near telomeres and centromeres, Polycomb-repressed regions and heterochromatin, genes involved in cell-adhesion, WNT signaling, cell fate, and putative human metastable epialleles. Our study also demonstrates a never-anticipated corollary: because identical twins keep a lifelong molecular signature, we can retrospectively diagnose if a person was conceived as monozygotic twin.},

The package summarizes 450k experiments into small exportable R objects from which an interactive interface is launched. Reactive plots allow fast and intuitive quality control assessment of the samples. In addition, exploration of the phenotypic associations is possible through coloring and principal component analysis. Altogether, the package makes it easy to perform quality assessment of large-scale methylation datasets, such as epigenome-wide association studies or the datasets available through The Cancer Genome Atlas portal. The shinyMethyl package is implemented in R and available via Bioconductor. Its development repository is at https://github.com/jfortin1/shinyMethyl.},

	abstract = {Background: DNA methylation changes with age. Chronological age predictors built from DNA methylation are termed ‘epigenetic clocks’. The deviation of predicted age from the actual age (‘age acceleration residual’, AAR) has been reported to be associated with death. However, it is currently unclear how a better prediction of chronological age affects such association.
Methods: In this study, we build multiple predictors based on training DNA methylation samples selected from 13, 661 samples (13,402 from blood and 259 from saliva). We use the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (LBC1921) and 1936 (LBC1936) to examine whether the association between AAR (from these predictors) and death is affected by (1) improving prediction accuracy of an age predictor as its training sample size increases (from 335 to 12,710) and (2) additionally correcting for confounders (i.e., cellular compositions). In addition, we investigated the performance of our predictor in non-blood tissues.
Results: We found that in principle, a near-perfect age predictor could be developed when the training sample size is sufficiently large. The association between AAR and mortality attenuates as prediction accuracy increases. AAR from our best predictor (based on Elastic Net, https://github.com/qzhang314/DNAm-based-age-predictor) exhibits no association with mortality in both LBC1921 (hazard ratio = 1.08, 95\% CI 0.91–1.27) and LBC1936 (hazard ratio = 1.00, 95\% CI 0.79–1.28). Predictors based on small sample size are prone to confounding by cellular compositions relative to those from large sample size. We observed comparable performance of our predictor in non-blood tissues with a multi-tissue-based predictor.
Conclusions: This study indicates that the epigenetic clock can be improved by increasing the training sample size and that its association with mortality attenuates with increased prediction of chronological age.},

	title = {Validation and characterisation of a {DNA} methylation alcohol biomarker across the life course},
	volume = {11},
	abstract = {Background: Recently, an alcohol predictor was developed using DNA methylation at 144 CpG sites (DNAm-Alc) as a biomarker for improved clinical or epidemiologic assessment of alcohol-related ill health. We validate the performance and characterise the drivers of this DNAm-Alc for the first time in independent populations.
Results: In N = 1049 parents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies (ARIES) at midlife, we found DNAm-Alc explained 7.6\% of the variation in alcohol intake, roughly half of what had been reported previously, and interestingly explained a larger 9.8\% of Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score, a scale of alcohol use disorder. Explanatory capacity in participants from the offspring generation of ARIES measured during adolescence was much lower. However, DNAm-Alc explained 14.3\% of the variation in replication using the Head and Neck 5000 (HN5000) clinical cohort that had higher average alcohol consumption. To investigate whether this relationship was being driven by genetic and/or earlier environment confounding, we examined how earlier versus concurrent DNAm-Alc measures predicted AUDIT scores. In both ARIES parental and offspring generations, we observed associations between AUDIT and concurrent, but not earlier DNAm-Alc, suggesting independence from genetic and stable environmental contributions.
Conclusions: The stronger relationship between DNAm-Alcs and AUDIT in parents at midlife compared to adolescents despite similar levels of consumption suggests that DNAm-Alc likely reflects long-term patterns of alcohol abuse. Such biomarkers may have potential applications for biomonitoring and risk prediction, especially in cases where reporting bias is a concern.},

	abstract = {Background The relationship between obesity and adverse health is well established, but little is known about the contribution of DNA methylation to obesity-related health outcomes. This study tests associations between an epigenetic score for body mass index (BMI) and health-related, cognitive, psychosocial and lifestyle outcomes in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. This study also tests whether these associations are independent of phenotypic BMI.
Method Analyses were conducted using data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (n = 892). Weights for the epigenetic BMI score were derived using penalised regression on methylation data from unrelated Generation Scotland participants (n = 2562). Associations were tested for replication in an independent sample: the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (n = 433).
Results A higher epigenetic BMI score was associated with higher BMI (R2 = 0.1), greater body weight (R2 = 0.06), greater time taken to walk 6 m, poorer lung function and poorer general physical health (all R2 = 0.02), greater levels of triglycerides (R2 = 0.09), greater \%total HbA1c (R2 = 0.06), lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL; R2 = 0.08), higher HDL ratio (HDL/total cholesterol; R2 = 0.03), lower health-related quality of life, physical inactivity, and greater social deprivation (all R2 = 0.02). The epigenetic BMI score (per SD) was also associated with type 2 diabetes (OR 2.17, 95\% CI 1.67, 2.84), cardiovascular disease (OR 1.45, 95\% CI 1.24, 1.71) and high blood pressure (OR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.13, 1.49; all p {\textless} 0.00026 after Bonferroni correction). Associations were replicated for BMI (R2 = 0.06), body weight (R2 = 0.04), health-related quality of life (R2 = 0.02), HbA1c (R2 = 0.07) and triglycerides (R2 = 0.07; all p {\textless} 0.0045 after Bonferroni correction).
Conclusions We observed and replicated associations between an epigenetic score for BMI and variables related to poor physical health and metabolic syndrome. Regression models with both epigenetic and phenotypic BMI scores as predictors accounted for a greater proportion of variance in all outcome variables than either predictor alone, demonstrating independent and additive effects of epigenetic and phenotypic BMI scores.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with an estimated heritability between 40 and 50\%. DNA methylation patterns can serve as proxies of (past) exposures and disease progression, as well as providing a potential mechanism that mediates genetic or environmental risk. Here, we present a blood-based epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis in 9706 samples passing stringent quality control (6763 patients, 2943 controls). We identified a total of 45 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) annotated to 42 genes, which are enriched for pathways and traits related to metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, and immunity. We then tested 39 DNA methylation–based proxies of putative ALS risk factors and found that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, white blood cell proportions, and alcohol intake were independently associated with ALS. Integration of these results with our latest genome-wide association study showed that cholesterol biosynthesis was potentially causally related to ALS. Last, DNA methylation at several DMPs and blood cell proportion estimates derived from DNA methylation data were associated with survival rate in patients, suggesting that they might represent indicators of underlying disease processes potentially amenable to therapeutic interventions.

              Neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have been associated to epigenetic modifications, suggesting that identification of specific epigenetic patterns could provide insights into disease pathophysiology and help the identification of potential pharmacological targets. Here, Hop
              et al.
              analyzed DNA methylation pattern, one of the most characterized epigenetic modifications, in almost 10,000 individuals with ALS and controls and identified 45 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) annotated to 42 genes. The changes involved genes associated to metabolic and inflammatory pathways, and the authors identified several DMPs associated with disease progression in their cohort. The results will help the identification of disease-relevant mechanisms that could be targeted to block or delay ALS progression.},
